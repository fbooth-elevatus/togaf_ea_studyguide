## 2. Introduction
- **Purpose:** Define the application systems and their interactions to support the enterprise’s business processes and data needs.
- **Scope:** [Describe what’s included, e.g., “Applications for e-commerce platform; excludes legacy payroll system.”]
- **Objectives:** 
  - [e.g., Streamline customer interactions]
  - [e.g., Integrate with existing data systems]

## 3. Architecture Overview
- **Context:** [Briefly describe the business need, e.g., “Support online retail modernization.”]
- **High-Level Description:** [Summarize the application solution, e.g., “Integrated CRM and e-commerce suite with APIs.”]
- **Diagram:** [Placeholder for diagram—e.g., “Insert application landscape showing components and interfaces.”]

## 4. Baseline Application Architecture
- **Current State Description:** [Describe existing applications, e.g., “Separate POS and online store apps with manual data sync.”]
- **Components:**
  | Application       | Description                | Status          |
  |-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
  | [e.g., POS System]| [e.g., In-store sales app] | [e.g., Legacy]  |
  | [e.g., Web Store] | [e.g., Basic e-commerce]   | [e.g., Stable]  |
- **Issues:** [List problems, e.g., “No real-time integration, high maintenance effort.”]

## 5. Target Application Architecture
- **Future State Description:** [Describe desired applications, e.g., “Unified e-commerce platform with CRM integration.”]
- **Components:**
  | Application       | Description                | Technology      |
  |-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
  | [e.g., CRM]       | [e.g., Customer management]| [e.g., Salesforce] |
  | [e.g., E-commerce]| [e.g., Online sales]      | [e.g., Shopify] |
- **Benefits:** [List advantages, e.g., “Real-time data sync, improved customer experience.”]

## 6. Gap Analysis
- **Gaps Between Baseline and Target:**
  | Gap Description             | Impact                  | Resolution             |
  |-----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
  | [e.g., No CRM system]       | [e.g., Customer tracking]| [e.g., Deploy CRM]    |
  | [e.g., Manual sync]         | [e.g., Data delays]     | [e.g., API integration]|
- **Dependencies:** [e.g., “CRM deployment requires Data Architecture updates.”]

## 7. Application Standards and Principles
- **Standards:** [List adopted standards, e.g., “RESTful APIs, SOA principles.”]
- **Principles:** 
  - [e.g., “Favor interoperable, modular applications.”]
  - [e.g., “Minimize custom development.”]

## 8. Requirements
- **Functional Requirements:** [e.g., “Support online order processing for 5,000 users.”]
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** 
  - [e.g., “Application uptime > 99.5%.”]
  - [e.g., “Response time < 1 second.”]

## 9. Risks and Mitigation
- **Risks:**
  | Risk                  | Likelihood | Impact   | Mitigation             |
  |-----------------------|------------|----------|------------------------|
  | [e.g., Integration failure] | [Medium]   | [High]   | [Test APIs pre-launch] |
  | [e.g., Vendor delay]  | [Low]      | [Medium] | [Set firm deadlines]   |
- **Assumptions:** [e.g., “Existing staff can learn new app interfaces.”]

## 10. Implementation Considerations
- **Approach:** [e.g., “Parallel deployment: new apps alongside legacy until stable.”]
- **Dependencies:** [e.g., “Requires Technology Architecture (Phase D) for hosting.”]
- **Next Steps:** [e.g., “Select vendors, initiate pilot testing.”]

## 11. Stakeholder Validation
- **Stakeholders:**
  | Name          | Role              | Concern             | Sign-Off Date |
  |---------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
  | [e.g., CIO]   | [e.g., Approver]  | [e.g., Integration] | [TBD]         |
  | [e.g., IT Lead]| [e.g., Implementer]| [e.g., Usability]  | [TBD]         |
