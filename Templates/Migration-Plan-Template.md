- **Objectives:** 
  - [e.g., Achieve target architecture within 12 months]
  - [e.g., Minimize business disruption]

## 3. Migration Overview
- **Context:** [Briefly describe the need, e.g., “Move from legacy systems to a modern cloud-based platform.”]
- **High-Level Strategy:** [Summarize approach, e.g., “Phased migration with parallel running of old and new systems.”]
- **Diagram:** [Placeholder for diagram—e.g., “Insert timeline or transition architecture map.”]

## 4. Transition Architectures
- **Stages:** [List intermediate states between baseline and target]
  | Stage             | Description                | Target Completion |
  |-------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
  | [e.g., Stage 1]   | [e.g., Cloud setup]        | [e.g., Q2 2025]   |
  | [e.g., Stage 2]   | [e.g., App migration]      | [e.g., Q3 2025]   |
- **Key Changes:** [e.g., “Stage 1: Deploy AWS infrastructure; Stage 2: Integrate CRM.”]

## 5. Work Packages
- **Prioritized Projects:**
  | Work Package      | Description                | Priority | Cost Estimate | Duration |
  |-------------------|----------------------------|----------|---------------|----------|
  | [e.g., Cloud Migration] | [e.g., Move servers to AWS] | [High]   | [$50,000]     | [3 months] |
  | [e.g., CRM Deployment] | [e.g., Install Salesforce] | [Medium] | [$30,000]     | [2 months] |
- **Dependencies:** [e.g., “CRM deployment depends on cloud migration completion.”]

## 6. Implementation Timeline
- **Schedule:**
  | Milestone         | Description                | Date            |
  |-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
  | [e.g., Kickoff]   | [e.g., Project start]      | [e.g., Apr 2025] |
  | [e.g., Stage 1 Complete] | [e.g., Cloud live]   | [e.g., Jun 2025] |
  | [e.g., Full Migration] | [e.g., Target achieved] | [e.g., Sep 2025] |
- **Critical Path:** [e.g., “Cloud setup must finish before app migration begins.”]

## 7. Resource Plan
- **Resources:**
  | Resource Type     | Description                | Quantity | Cost         |
  |-------------------|----------------------------|----------|--------------|
  | [e.g., Staff]     | [e.g., IT engineers]       | [5]      | [$100,000]   |
  | [e.g., Vendor]    | [e.g., AWS consultant]     | [1]      | [$20,000]    |
- **Budget Summary:** [e.g., “Total estimated cost: $150,000.”]

## 8. Risks and Mitigation

  |-----------------------|------------|----------|------------------------|
  | [e.g., Migration delay] | [Medium]   | [High]   | [Parallel testing]     |
  | [e.g., Data loss]     | [Low]      | [High]   | [Backup before move]   |
- **Assumptions:** [e.g., “Vendor delivers on time; staff trained by Q2.”]

## 9. Governance and Monitoring
- **Governance Structure:** [e.g., “Architecture Board reviews monthly progress.”]
- **Monitoring Plan:** [e.g., “Weekly status reports, compliance checks at milestones.”]
- **Success Criteria:** [e.g., “99.9% uptime post-migration, full functionality by Q3.”]
