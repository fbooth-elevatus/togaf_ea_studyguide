# Business Architecture Template

## 1. Document Information
- **Project Name:** [Insert Project Name]
- **Version:** [e.g., 1.0]
- **Date:** [Insert Date, e.g., March 20, 2025]
- **Prepared By:** [Your Name/Team]
- **Approved By:** [Stakeholder Name(s)]

## 2. Introduction
- **Purpose:** Define the business structure, processes, and capabilities to achieve enterprise goals and support the Architecture Vision.
- **Scope:** [Describe what’s included, e.g., “Core e-commerce processes; excludes supply chain logistics.”]
- **Objectives:** 
  - [e.g., Improve customer order fulfillment efficiency]
  - [e.g., Align business operations with digital strategy]

## 3. Architecture Overview
- **Context:** [Briefly describe the business need, e.g., “Modernize retail operations for online growth.”]
- **High-Level Description:** [Summarize the business solution, e.g., “Streamlined order-to-delivery process with integrated roles.”]
- **Diagram:** [Placeholder for diagram—e.g., “Insert process flow or org chart showing key functions.”]

## 4. Baseline Business Architecture
- **Current State Description:** [Describe existing business, e.g., “Manual order processing, siloed departments.”]
- **Components:**
  | Component         | Description                | Status          |
  |-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
  | [e.g., Order Process] | [e.g., Manual entry]   | [e.g., Inefficient] |
  | [e.g., Customer Support] | [e.g., Call center] | [e.g., Stable]  |
- **Issues:** [List problems, e.g., “Slow order turnaround, poor data sharing.”]

## 5. Target Business Architecture
- **Future State Description:** [Describe desired business, e.g., “Automated order processing with cross-functional teams.”]
- **Components:**
  | Component         | Description                | Capability      |
  |-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
  | [e.g., Order Process] | [e.g., Automated workflow] | [e.g., Real-time] |
  | [e.g., Customer Support] | [e.g., Omni-channel]  | [e.g., Proactive] |
- **Benefits:** [List advantages, e.g., “Faster delivery, better customer satisfaction.”]

## 6. Gap Analysis
- **Gaps Between Baseline and Target:**
  | Gap Description             | Impact                  | Resolution             |
  |-----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
  | [e.g., Manual processes]    | [e.g., Delays]          | [e.g., Automate workflow] |
  | [e.g., Siloed teams]        | [e.g., Coordination]    | [e.g., Integrate roles] |
- **Dependencies:** [e.g., “Process automation requires Application Architecture updates.”]

## 7. Business Standards and Principles
- **Standards:** [List adopted standards, e.g., “BPMN for process modeling, ISO 9001 for quality.”]
- **Principles:** 
  - [e.g., “Customer-centric processes first.”]
  - [e.g., “Minimize operational silos.”]

## 8. Requirements
- **Functional Requirements:** [e.g., “Handle 1,000 orders daily.”]
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** 
  - [e.g., “Order processing time < 24 hours.”]
  - [e.g., “Error rate < 1%.”]

## 9. Risks and Mitigation
- **Risks:**
  | Risk                  | Likelihood | Impact   | Mitigation             |
  |-----------------------|------------|----------|------------------------|
  | [e.g., Staff resistance] | [Medium]   | [High]   | [Training program]     |
  | [e.g., Process disruption] | [Low]    | [Medium] | [Phased rollout]       |
- **Assumptions:** [e.g., “Staff can adapt to new processes with support.”]

## 10. Implementation Considerations
- **Approach:** [e.g., “Pilot new process in one region before full rollout.”]
- **Dependencies:** [e.g., “Requires Application Architecture (Phase C) for automation.”]
- **Next Steps:** [e.g., “Map detailed workflows, train key staff.”]

## 11. Stakeholder Validation
- **Stakeholders:**
  | Name          | Role              | Concern             | Sign-Off Date |
  |---------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
  | [e.g., COO]   | [e.g., Approver]  | [e.g., Efficiency]  | [TBD]         |
  | [e.g., Ops Lead]| [e.g., Implementer]| [e.g., Feasibility]| [TBD]         |
