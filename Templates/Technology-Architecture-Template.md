- **Date:** [Insert Date, e.g., March 10, 2025]
- **Prepared By:** [Your Name/Team]
- **Approved By:** [Stakeholder Name(s)]

## 2. Introduction
- **Purpose:** Define the technology infrastructure (hardware, software, networks) to support the enterprise’s business, data, and application architectures.
- **Scope:** [Describe what’s included, e.g., “Cloud infrastructure for e-commerce platform; excludes physical store systems.”]
- **Objectives:** 
  - [e.g., Enable scalability for online transactions]
  - [e.g., Reduce latency in customer-facing systems]

## 3. Architecture Overview
- **Context:** [Briefly describe the business need, e.g., “Support a modernized e-commerce platform.”]
- **High-Level Description:** [Summarize the technology solution, e.g., “Cloud-based infrastructure with API-driven services.”]
- **Diagram:** [Placeholder for diagram—e.g., “Insert architecture diagram showing servers, networks, and connections.”]

## 4. Baseline Technology Architecture
- **Current State Description:** [Describe existing infrastructure, e.g., “On-premises servers, legacy network with 1 Gbps bandwidth.”]
- **Components:**
  | Component         | Description                | Status          |
  |-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
  | [e.g., Servers]   | [e.g., 5 physical servers] | [e.g., Outdated]|
  | [e.g., Network]   | [e.g., LAN, 1 Gbps]       | [e.g., Stable]  |
- **Issues:** [List problems, e.g., “Limited scalability, high maintenance costs.”]

## 5. Target Technology Architecture
- **Future State Description:** [Describe desired infrastructure, e.g., “AWS cloud hosting, 10 Gbps network.”]
- **Components:**
  | Component         | Description                | Standards/Tech  |
  |-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
  | [e.g., Servers]   | [e.g., AWS EC2 instances]  | [e.g., Linux]   |
  | [e.g., Network]   | [e.g., VPC, 10 Gbps]       | [e.g., TCP/IP]  |
- **Benefits:** [List advantages, e.g., “Scalable, cost-efficient, faster response times.”]

## 6. Gap Analysis
- **Gaps Between Baseline and Target:**
  | Gap Description             | Impact                  | Resolution             |
  |-----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
  | [e.g., No cloud presence]   | [e.g., Scalability]     | [e.g., Migrate to AWS] |
  | [e.g., Slow network]        | [e.g., Latency]         | [e.g., Upgrade bandwidth] |
- **Dependencies:** [e.g., “Network upgrade before server migration.”]

## 7. Technology Standards and Principles
- **Standards:** [List adopted standards, e.g., “ISO 27001 for security, RESTful APIs.”]
- **Principles:** 
  - [e.g., “Use cloud-first solutions where feasible.”]
  - [e.g., “Ensure high availability (>99.9%).”]

## 8. Requirements
- **Functional Requirements:** [e.g., “Support 10,000 concurrent users.”]
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** 
  - [e.g., “Response time < 2 seconds.”]
  - [e.g., “99.9% uptime.”]

## 9. Risks and Mitigation
- **Risks:**
  | Risk                  | Likelihood | Impact   | Mitigation             |
  |-----------------------|------------|----------|------------------------|
  | [e.g., Migration downtime] | [Medium]   | [High]   | [Pre-test in staging]  |
  | [e.g., Cost overrun]  | [Low]      | [Medium] | [Budget contingency]   |
- **Assumptions:** [e.g., “Existing staff can manage AWS after training.”]

## 10. Implementation Considerations
- **Approach:** [e.g., “Phased migration: servers first, then network.”]
- **Dependencies:** [e.g., “Requires Data Architecture completion (Phase C).”]
- **Next Steps:** [e.g., “Finalize vendor contracts, begin pilot deployment.”]

## 11. Stakeholder Validation
- **Stakeholders:**
  | Name          | Role              | Concern             | Sign-Off Date |
  |---------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
  | [e.g., CTO]   | [e.g., Approver]  | [e.g., Cost, ROI]   | [TBD]         |
  | [e.g., IT Ops]| [e.g., Implementer]| [e.g., Feasibility] | [TBD]         |
