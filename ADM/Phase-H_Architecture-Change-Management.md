# Phase H: Architecture Change Management

## Purpose
Phase H establishes a process to manage changes to the architecture after implementation, ensuring it adapts to new business needs, technology shifts, or unexpected issues. It maintains the architecture’s alignment with enterprise goals and prepares for the next ADM iteration.

- **Key Objective:** Keep the architecture dynamic and responsive to change.

## Key Activities
- **Monitor Environment:** Track business trends, technology advancements, and performance metrics.
- **Assess Change Requests:** Evaluate proposed changes for impact and value (e.g., new requirements, gaps).
- **Classify Changes:** Determine if changes are incremental (minor) or require re-architecting (major).
- **Manage Architecture Updates:** Update the Architecture Definition Document as needed.
- **Trigger New ADM Cycle:** Initiate a new iteration if significant changes warrant it.
- **Maintain Governance:** Ensure changes align with principles and standards.
- **Engage Stakeholders:** Communicate updates and gather feedback.

## Inputs
- **Architecture Vision:** From Phase A, as the baseline for alignment.
- **Architecture Definition Document:** Current state from Phases B-G.
- **Implementation and Migration Plan:** From Phase F, showing what’s been deployed.
- **Compliance Review Reports:** From Phase G, highlighting performance.
- **Change Requests:** New needs from stakeholders or monitoring.
- **Architecture Repository:** Reference models and lessons learned.

## Outputs
- **Updated Architecture Definition Document:** Revised to reflect approved changes.
- **Change Management Process:** Established guidelines for ongoing updates.
- **Architecture Updates:** Modified building blocks or standards.
- **Request for Architecture Work:** If a new ADM cycle is triggered.
- **Performance Metrics:** Reports on architecture effectiveness post-change.
- **Stakeholder Communications:** Updates on changes and their impacts.

## Key Concepts
- **Change Management:** A continuous process, not a one-time event.
- **Incremental vs. Major Change:** Incremental tweaks vs. a full re-architecture.
- **Monitoring:** Proactive tracking of drivers (e.g., market shifts, tech advances).
- **Iteration:** Phase H loops back to Preliminary or Phase A for major updates.

## Study Notes
- **Exam Focus:** Know Phase H as the maintenance phase. Understand its role in keeping architecture relevant.
- **Link to Phase G:** Follows implementation governance—grasp how it shifts from oversight to adaptation.
- **Deliverables:** The updated Architecture Definition Document is key—memorize its purpose.
- **Change Types:** Be ready to distinguish incremental vs. major changes on the exam.

## Example Scenario
- **Context:** Retail company with modernized e-commerce platform (from Phases A-G).
- **Phase H Steps:**
  1. Monitor: Customer feedback shows slow mobile app performance.
  2. Change Request: Upgrade server capacity for better speed.
  3. Assess: Incremental change—adjust Technology Architecture.
  4. Update: Revise architecture with new server specs.
  5. Output: Updated document and stakeholder approval; no new cycle needed.
