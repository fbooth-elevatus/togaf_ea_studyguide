# Phase H: Architecture Change Management

## Purpose

The **Architecture Change Management** phase ensures that enterprise architecture remains **adaptive, relevant, and aligned with business and technology evolution**. This phase establishes a structured process for monitoring, evaluating, and managing changes to **prevent architecture drift and maintain long-term sustainability**.

## Objectives

- **Ensure Architecture Adaptability** – Enable continuous improvement to align with **business strategy, regulatory changes, and emerging technologies**.
- **Manage Change Requests** – Implement a structured process for evaluating, approving, and implementing **architecture modifications**.
- **Determine When to Reinitiate the ADM Cycle** – Identify **significant changes** that require a **new iteration of the Architecture Development Method (ADM)**.

---

## Approach

This phase involves **monitoring business and IT landscapes**, identifying **change drivers**, assessing their impact, and **determining appropriate responses**. By systematically managing changes, organizations ensure that their architecture evolves in a **controlled and strategic manner**.

## Steps

### 1. Establish a Monitoring Framework
- **What:** Implement **continuous monitoring of business trends, regulations, and technology shifts**.
- **Example:** A **global e-commerce company** tracks **AI-driven recommendation engines and customer personalization trends** to enhance user experience.

### 2. Identify and Document Change Drivers
- **What:** Recognize **internal and external factors** that may necessitate architectural modifications.
- **Example:** A **financial institution** responds to **new government cybersecurity regulations** by enhancing its **data encryption and fraud detection capabilities**.

### 3. Assess the Impact of Changes
- **What:** Evaluate **how proposed changes affect business processes, IT systems, security, and costs**.
- **Example:** A **hospital network** assesses how **adopting AI-based diagnostics** will affect **patient data storage, compliance, and integration with existing medical records**.

### 4. Define the Scope of Change
- **What:** Determine if changes require **minor adjustments, major restructuring, or a new ADM cycle**.
- **Example:** A **logistics company** integrating **autonomous delivery drones** realizes that **significant architecture modifications** are required for **fleet management and compliance**.

### 5. Implement Approved Changes
- **What:** Execute **changes through defined governance structures** while maintaining architectural integrity.
- **Example:** A **telecom provider** implements **5G infrastructure upgrades**, ensuring minimal disruption to existing networks.

### 6. Review and Close Change Requests
- **What:** Assess **whether changes achieved intended business and technical outcomes** before formally closing the request.
- **Example:** A **government agency** completes a **cloud migration for digital identity services**, ensuring it meets **performance, security, and accessibility standards**.
