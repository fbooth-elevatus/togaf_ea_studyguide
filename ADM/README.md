## ADM Phases and Descriptions

The TOGAF ADM consists of **ten phases**, each with a specific focus on enterprise architecture development.

### **1. Preliminary Phase**
- Establishes the **architecture framework**, governance, and guiding principles.
- Defines the **roles, responsibilities, and scope** of enterprise architecture.

### **2. Phase A: Architecture Vision**
- Develops the **high-level vision** of the architecture.
- Engages stakeholders and defines the **business case**.
- Establishes the **scope, objectives, and constraints**.

### **3. Phase B: Business Architecture**
- Analyzes and defines **business processes, capabilities, and structures**.
- Aligns business goals with technology investments.
- Documents key business **functions, roles, and workflows**.

### **4. Phase C: Information Systems Architectures**
- Defines **Data Architecture** (how data is structured, stored, and managed).
- Defines **Application Architecture** (how applications interact with business processes).

### **5. Phase D: Technology Architecture**
- Establishes the **technology infrastructure** supporting the information systems.
- Defines **networking, hardware, cloud environments, and security considerations**.

### **6. Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions**
- Identifies **gaps and solutions** to transition from current to future architecture.
- Develops a **high-level roadmap** for implementation.

### **7. Phase F: Migration Planning**
- Prioritizes projects and dependencies for **architecture implementation**.
- Develops a **detailed migration plan** with budget, risks, and key milestones.

### **8. Phase G: Implementation Governance**
- Ensures **project execution aligns** with the defined architecture.
- Establishes **governance frameworks, controls, and review processes**.

### **9. Phase H: Architecture Change Management**
- Manages **continuous monitoring and adaptation** of the architecture.
- Defines a **process for handling necessary updates and changes**.

### **10. Requirements Management**
- Overarches all phases to manage **evolving business and technology requirements**.
- Ensures that **architecture remains relevant and adaptable** over time.

## **Real-World Example: TOGAF ADM in Retail Digital Transformation**

### **Scenario**
A **global retail company** wants to integrate its **physical stores, e-commerce platform, and customer service systems** to improve the **customer experience and streamline operations**.

### **Application of TOGAF ADM:**

| **ADM Phase**          | **Application in Retail Industry** |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Preliminary Phase**  | Define an **enterprise-wide architecture framework** for digital transformation. Establish governance models. |
| **Phase A**            | Develop a **high-level vision** for integrating online and offline shopping experiences. Identify key stakeholders (IT, marketing, logistics). |
| **Phase B**            | Map out current and future **business processes**. Define how sales, inventory, and customer service teams will collaborate. |
| **Phase C**            | Design a **centralized data repository** for customer profiles. Define integration points between POS, CRM, and e-commerce systems. |
| **Phase D**            | Implement a **cloud-based microservices architecture**. Define APIs for seamless communication between systems. |
| **Phase E**            | Identify **technology vendors** for CRM, ERP, and analytics. Select **e-commerce and cloud providers**. |
| **Phase F**            | Develop a **migration strategy** to phase out legacy systems while onboarding new solutions. Create a **pilot rollout plan**. |
| **Phase G**            | Establish **KPIs and governance frameworks** to track implementation success. Conduct compliance audits. |
| **Phase H**            | Implement a **feedback mechanism** to refine and improve the architecture continuously. |
| **Requirements Management** | Track changing **market trends, customer preferences, and emerging technologies** to ensure future adaptability. |

### **Expected Outcomes**
- **Seamless omnichannel experience** (customers can shop online and pick up in-store).
- **Unified data across departments**, improving customer insights and decision-making.
- **Reduced IT maintenance costs** by transitioning to **cloud-based solutions**.
