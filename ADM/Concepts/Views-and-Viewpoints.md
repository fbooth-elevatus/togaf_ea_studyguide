# Views and Viewpoints in TOGAF

## **Overview**
In TOGAF, **Views and Viewpoints** are essential for communicating architectural decisions to stakeholders with different concerns. They help structure architecture documentation in a way that is understandable and relevant to various audiences.

- **A View** represents a perspective of the architecture, focusing on specific concerns.
- **A Viewpoint** is a template or standard that defines how views should be created and what elements they should include.

By defining **clear views and viewpoints**, TOGAF ensures that architecture artifacts effectively address stakeholder needs and provide actionable insights.

## **Understanding Views and Viewpoints**
### **What is a View?**
A **view** is a representation of the architecture from the perspective of a specific set of concerns. Different stakeholders require different views based on their roles and responsibilities.

### **What is a Viewpoint?**
A **viewpoint** defines:
- The concerns it addresses
- The stakeholders it serves
- The models, tools, and methods used to create the view

Each viewpoint ensures consistency in architecture documentation and supports decision-making.

## **TOGAF's Approach to Views and Viewpoints**
TOGAF categorizes views and viewpoints based on stakeholder concerns. The most common viewpoints include:

| **Viewpoint** | **Stakeholders** | **Purpose** |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Business Viewpoint** | Executives, Business Analysts, Product Owners | Describes business processes, objectives, and key capabilities. |
| **Application Viewpoint** | Application Architects, Developers | Shows how applications interact, dependencies, and integration points. |
| **Data Viewpoint** | Data Architects, Security Officers | Illustrates data models, ownership, security, and flows. |
| **Technology Viewpoint** | IT Operations, Infrastructure Architects | Focuses on hardware, networks, cloud architecture, and security. |
| **Security Viewpoint** | CISOs, Risk Managers, Compliance Officers | Defines security controls, compliance, and risk management. |
