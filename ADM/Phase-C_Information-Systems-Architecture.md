# Phase C: Information Systems Architecture

## Purpose
Phase C develops the Information Systems Architecture, encompassing the Data Architecture (how data is structured and managed) and the Application Architecture (how applications support business processes). It ensures the enterprise’s information and application systems align with the Business Architecture and the broader Architecture Vision.

- **Key Objective:** Define the data and application frameworks to enable business capabilities.

## Key Activities
- **Select Reference Models and Viewpoints:** Use standards (e.g., data models, application portfolios) relevant to the organization.
- **Develop Baseline Data Architecture:** Document the current state of data entities, storage, and flows.
- **Develop Target Data Architecture:** Define the future state of data management aligned with business needs.
- **Develop Baseline Application Architecture:** Map existing applications and their interactions.
- **Develop Target Application Architecture:** Design the future application landscape to support the business.
- **Perform Gap Analysis:** Identify gaps between baseline and target for both data and applications.
- **Resolve Impacts:** Assess how changes affect other architectures (e.g., Business, Technology).
- **Validate with Stakeholders:** Confirm the architecture meets stakeholder requirements.

## Inputs
- **Architecture Vision:** High-level goals from Phase A.
- **Business Architecture:** Processes and capabilities from Phase B.
- **Statement of Architecture Work:** Scope and constraints.
- **Existing IT Assets:** Current data models, application inventories, and systems documentation.
- **Architecture Repository:** Reusable data and application building blocks.

## Outputs
- **Data Architecture Document:** Baseline and target descriptions of data entities, relationships, and management.
- **Application Architecture Document:** Baseline and target views of applications, interfaces, and interactions.
- **Gap Analysis Results:** Gaps between current and desired states for data and applications.
- **Updated Architecture Definition Document:** Expanded with Data and Application Architectures.
- **Refined Requirements:** Updated based on Phase C findings.
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** Documented validation from reviews.

## Key Concepts
- **Data Architecture:** Focuses on data entities, standards, and flows (e.g., customer data, order data).
- **Application Architecture:** Defines applications and their relationships (e.g., CRM, ERP).
- **Two Sub-Phases:** Phase C is split into Data and Application, though they can be done in parallel or sequence.
- **Gap Analysis:** Critical for identifying missing data capabilities or application functionality.

## Study Notes
- **Exam Focus:** Know that Phase C covers two domains: Data and Application Architectures. Memorize their purpose and key deliverables.
- **Link to Phase B:** Business Architecture drives the requirements for data and applications—understand this dependency.
- **Deliverables:** Be ready to identify outputs like Data and Application Architecture Documents on the exam.
- **Techniques:** Gap Analysis and stakeholder validation are key—review their application here.

## Example Scenario
- **Context:** Retail company modernizing its e-commerce platform (from Phases A and B).
- **Phase C Steps:**
  1. Baseline Data: Current customer data in spreadsheets; order data in legacy database.
  2. Target Data: Centralized data warehouse with standardized customer and order entities.
  3. Baseline Apps: Separate POS and online store systems with manual integration.
  4. Target Apps: Integrated e-commerce platform with CRM and real-time inventory.
  5. Gap: Lack of data integration and modern application suite.
  6. Output: Data and Application Architecture Documents validated by IT and marketing teams.
