# Phase C: Information Systems Architecture

## Purpose

The **Information Systems Architecture** phase focuses on developing the **Data Architecture** and **Application Architecture** needed to support business operations and strategic goals. This phase ensures that information systems are structured to effectively **store, manage, process, and exchange data**, while applications are aligned with **business processes and user needs**.

---

## Objectives

- **Develop Target Data Architecture** – Define how data is structured, stored, and accessed across the enterprise.
- **Develop Target Application Architecture** – Identify the necessary applications to support business functions and integrate with data systems.
- **Perform Gap Analysis** – Compare the current (baseline) and future (target) architectures to identify necessary changes.
- **Define the Roadmap for Implementation** – Outline the key steps required to transition from baseline to target architectures.

## Approach

This phase consists of two major components:
1. **Data Architecture** – Defines **how data is collected, stored, shared, and secured** across systems.
2. **Application Architecture** – Identifies **the key applications needed to support business functions** and their interactions.

The order of execution may vary depending on organizational needs, but both domains must be addressed for a **cohesive enterprise information systems strategy**.

## Steps

### 1. Select Reference Models, Viewpoints, and Tools
- **What:** Choose standards, frameworks, and tools for architecture development.
- **Example:** A **financial services company** selects the **Banking Industry Architecture Network (BIAN) model** and uses **ArchiMate** for system modeling.

### 2. Develop Baseline Data Architecture
- **What:** Document the **current state of data management, storage, and governance**.
- **Example:** A **retail company** maps existing **customer databases, product inventory systems, and point-of-sale data flows**.

### 3. Develop Target Data Architecture
- **What:** Define how data will be **structured, secured, and integrated in the future**.
- **Example:** A **healthcare provider** plans to implement a **centralized electronic health record (EHR) system** for seamless patient data sharing.

### 4. Perform Gap Analysis for Data Architecture
- **What:** Identify inconsistencies or inefficiencies between baseline and target data architectures.
- **Example:** A **manufacturing company** discovers its **legacy ERP system lacks real-time inventory visibility**, impacting supply chain efficiency.

### 5. Develop Baseline Application Architecture
- **What:** Map **existing applications and their interactions** with business processes.
- **Example:** A **telecommunications company** documents its **customer relationship management (CRM) system and billing platform**.

### 6. Develop Target Application Architecture
- **What:** Define **future applications that will support business needs**.
- **Example:** An **e-commerce company** plans to migrate to a **microservices-based architecture** for scalability and faster deployment.

### 7. Perform Gap Analysis for Application Architecture
- **What:** Identify **gaps between current applications and future business needs**.
- **Example:** A **logistics company** realizes its **warehouse management system lacks IoT-based tracking**, delaying shipments.

### 8. Define Roadmap for Transition
- **What:** Identify initiatives and **set priorities for implementation**.
- **Example:** A **banking institution** plans a **two-year phased migration to a cloud-based core banking system**.

### 9. Assess Impacts on Other Architecture Domains
- **What:** Evaluate how changes in **data and applications affect security, integration, and operations**.
- **Example:** An **insurance company** ensures that its **new claims processing system integrates with regulatory reporting platforms**.

### 10. Conduct Stakeholder Review
- **What:** Present findings to **IT, business leaders, and compliance teams** for validation.
- **Example:** A **government agency** reviews its **open data platform strategy** with multiple departments.

### 11. Finalize the Information Systems Architecture
- **What:** Document final **architecture models and obtain approval**.
- **Example:** A **pharmaceutical company** completes its **clinical trial data management architecture** for regulatory compliance.
