# Preliminary Phase: Establishing an Enterprise Architecture Capability

## Purpose

The Preliminary Phase is the foundation for establishing an **Enterprise Architecture (EA) capability** within an organization. This phase defines the overall architecture framework, governance structures, and principles that guide the EA practice. It ensures that architecture efforts are aligned with business objectives and regulatory requirements while setting up the necessary organizational support for long-term success.

## Objectives

- **Define the Scope of Enterprise Architecture**
  - Identify business goals, drivers, and strategic objectives.
  - Align EA with organizational priorities and existing frameworks.
  - Ensure EA efforts complement ongoing business transformation initiatives.

- **Establish the Architecture Function and Governance**
  - Define roles, responsibilities, and reporting structures for enterprise architects.
  - Develop an architecture governance model to manage compliance and oversight.
  - Ensure executive sponsorship and stakeholder engagement.

- **Customize the Architecture Framework**
  - Adapt TOGAF or integrate it with other methodologies like Agile, ITIL, or COBIT.
  - Establish a tailored framework suited to the organization’s culture and structure.
  - Define **Architecture Principles** that will guide decision-making.

- **Assess and Improve Enterprise Architecture Maturity**
  - Evaluate the current state of EA capability.
  - Define a **Capability Maturity Model** to measure progress.
  - Set clear milestones for EA capability improvements.

## Key Activities

### 1. Define the EA Organization and Governance Structure
- **What it is:** Establishing a structured team with well-defined roles, responsibilities, and reporting lines.  
- **Why it matters:** Clear governance ensures accountability and alignment with business objectives.  
- **Example:**  
  - A **financial institution** forms an EA team including:
    - **Chief Architect** – Leads EA strategy and governance.
    - **Business Architect** – Aligns business processes with IT strategy.
    - **IT Architect** – Designs technology solutions.
    - **Governance Lead** – Ensures compliance with regulatory standards.
  - The EA team reports to a governance board, which includes business leaders and IT executives.

### 2. Establish Architecture Principles
- **What it is:** A set of high-level guidelines that inform architecture decisions and ensure consistency.  
- **Why it matters:** Strong principles provide long-term strategic direction and avoid ad-hoc decision-making.  
- **Example:**  
  - A **government agency** adopts:
    - **Security by Design** – All systems must implement security controls from the beginning.
    - **Cloud First** – Cloud-based solutions must be considered before on-premise options.
    - **Interoperability** – Systems must be able to integrate with external platforms where needed.

### 3. Tailor TOGAF and Select Additional Frameworks
- **What it is:** Customizing TOGAF to suit the organization's needs and integrating it with complementary frameworks.  
- **Why it matters:** A one-size-fits-all approach does not work; organizations need an EA model that fits their specific industry and business environment.  
- **Example:**  
  - A **healthcare provider** integrates TOGAF with:
    - **HL7 and HIPAA** for patient data security and interoperability.
    - **ITIL** for IT service management and operational efficiency.

### 4. Implement EA Tools and Resources
- **What it is:** Identifying and deploying tools to support EA activities, such as modeling software, repositories, and collaboration platforms.  
- **Why it matters:** The right tools streamline architecture development, documentation, and governance.  
- **Example:**  
  - A **retail company** adopts:
    - **ArchiMate** for visual modeling of business and IT architectures.
    - **A central EA repository** to store artifacts, ensuring consistency across teams.
