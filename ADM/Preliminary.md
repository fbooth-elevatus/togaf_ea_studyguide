# Preliminary Phase: Establishing an Enterprise Architecture Capability

## Purpose

The Preliminary Phase is the foundation of enterprise architecture (EA) development. It defines the organization's approach to EA, establishes governance structures, and aligns architecture efforts with business goals. This phase ensures that the organization has a clear understanding of how enterprise architecture will be developed and maintained.

## Objectives

- **Define the EA Capability**  
  - Understand the current state of the organization and how EA fits within it.
  - Identify the scope of EA efforts and key business areas impacted.
  - Align EA with existing frameworks, methods, and business processes.
  - Define target maturity levels for EA within the organization.

- **Establish an EA Organization and Governance Model**  
  - Define the roles, responsibilities, and reporting structures for enterprise architects.
  - Establish governance processes to ensure accountability and adherence to best practices.
  - Select and implement tools to support EA activities.
  - Define architecture principles to guide future decision-making.

## Key Activities

### 1. Define the EA Team and Organizational Structure  
- **What it is:** This activity defines the structure of the EA team, including its members, roles, and responsibilities.  
- **Why it matters:** A clear organizational structure ensures effective collaboration and accountability.  
- **Example:**  
  - A financial institution forms an EA team with roles such as Chief Architect, Business Architect, IT Architect, and Governance Lead.  
  - The team reports to an executive steering committee that oversees EA initiatives and ensures alignment with business goals.

### 2. Establish Architecture Principles  
- **What it is:** A set of fundamental guidelines that shape how architecture decisions are made.  
- **Why it matters:** Principles ensure consistency and support long-term business and IT strategies.  
- **Example:**  
  - A government agency adopts "Security by Design" as an EA principle, requiring all IT systems to include security controls from the outset.  
  - A retail company establishes a "Cloud-First" strategy, prioritizing cloud services over on-premise infrastructure.

### 3. Tailor TOGAF and Other EA Frameworks  
- **What it is:** Adjusting TOGAF and other frameworks to fit the organization's specific needs and industry requirements.  
- **Why it matters:** Every organization has unique requirements, and a customized framework ensures relevance and practicality.  
- **Example:**  
  - A healthcare provider integrates TOGAF with HL7 and HIPAA regulations to ensure compliance with medical data exchange standards.  
  - A global logistics company incorporates ITIL practices into its EA framework to improve service management.

### 4. Implement EA Tools  
- **What it is:** Selecting and deploying software tools that support architecture modeling, documentation, and governance.  
- **Why it matters:** The right tools improve collaboration, automate workflows, and provide visibility into EA activities.  
- **Example:**  
  - A multinational corporation adopts an enterprise architecture repository tool to manage models and architecture artifacts.  
  - A government agency uses ArchiMate for visualizing complex architectures across multiple departments.

## Inputs and Outputs

### **Inputs**
| Input | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Business Principles, Goals, and Drivers** | The organization's high-level objectives and motivations. | A technology firm prioritizes rapid innovation to maintain a competitive edge. |
| **Existing Architecture Frameworks** | EA models or methodologies already in use. | A company is currently using the Zachman Framework for structuring its data architecture. |
| **Organizational Model for EA** | The structure and processes governing EA activities. | A retail enterprise establishes an EA board with representatives from IT and business units. |
| **Legal and Regulatory Requirements** | Laws and policies affecting architecture decisions. | A financial institution must comply with GDPR and PCI-DSS security standards. |
| **Current IT Capabilities** | The organization's existing IT landscape and limitations. | A manufacturing firm assesses whether legacy ERP systems can integrate with cloud platforms. |

### **Outputs**
| Output | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Tailored EA Framework** | A customized approach to EA aligned with organizational needs. | A telecom company combines TOGAF with Agile development methods to increase flexibility. |
| **Architecture Principles** | Guidelines that govern architecture decisions. | A logistics company adopts the principle of "Open APIs" to enhance third-party integration. |
| **EA Governance Model** | Defined roles, processes, and oversight structures. | A banking institution establishes an Architecture Review Board to approve major technology decisions. |
| **EA Capability Maturity Goals** | Targets for improving the organization's EA practices. | A government agency sets a goal to achieve full EA integration within five years. |
| **Request for Architecture Work** | A formal proposal to begin new EA initiatives. | A department submits a request to develop an enterprise-wide data strategy. |

## Summary

The Preliminary Phase is a critical step in setting up an enterprise architecture function. It ensures that the organization has a clear structure, well-defined principles, governance mechanisms, and the necessary tools to manage and guide EA efforts effectively. By tailoring TOGAF to meet the organization's specific needs, enterprise architects can create a structured, scalable, and efficient architecture framework that aligns with business objectives.
