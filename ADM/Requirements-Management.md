## Objectives

- **Establish a structured approach** to collect, document, and manage requirements.
- **Ensure traceability** of requirements across all architecture phases.
- **Facilitate impact analysis** to assess the effect of changing requirements on architecture.
- **Maintain consistency** in aligning requirements with business goals and enterprise architecture principles.
- **Enable change management** by providing a controlled mechanism to modify requirements when necessary.

---

## Approach

Requirements Management is **a central process in the TOGAF ADM** that interacts with **all phases** of the architecture lifecycle. As business needs evolve, this phase ensures that changes are **evaluated, prioritized, and integrated without disrupting architectural integrity**.

- Requirements are **identified** and **analyzed** during early ADM phases.
- Requirements are **validated and refined** in later ADM phases.
- New or modified requirements **feed back** into architecture development for continuous improvement.

## Steps

### 1. Capture Business and IT Requirements
- **What:** Identify **functional, non-functional, business, and compliance requirements** from stakeholders.
- **Example:** A **banking institution** defines a requirement for **real-time fraud detection** in online transactions.

### 2. Validate and Prioritize Requirements
- **What:** Assess **feasibility, impact, and alignment with business goals**.
- **Example:** A **healthcare provider** prioritizes **HIPAA compliance and patient data encryption** over UI design improvements.

### 3. Store and Maintain Requirements Repository
- **What:** Centralize **all requirements in a structured repository** for tracking and version control.
- **Example:** A **telecommunications company** uses **Jira and Confluence** to manage **5G infrastructure upgrade requirements**.

### 4. Assess Impact on Architecture
- **What:** Analyze how **new requirements affect existing architecture components**.
- **Example:** A **retail chain** evaluates the impact of **omnichannel shopping experiences** on its **current e-commerce and inventory systems**.

### 5. Ensure Traceability Across ADM Phases
- **What:** Link requirements to **business goals, architecture artifacts, and implementation projects**.
- **Example:** A **manufacturing firm** ensures that **IoT-driven predictive maintenance** aligns with **enterprise data strategy and cloud adoption roadmap**.

### 6. Handle Requirement Changes
- **What:** Implement a **change management process** to review, approve, and integrate modifications.
- **Example:** A **government agency** updates its **national identity verification system** to comply with **new data privacy laws**.

### 7. Feed Changes Back into ADM Cycle
- **What:** Continuously **refine and integrate evolving requirements** into architecture.
- **Example:** A **fintech startup** revises its **AI-based credit risk assessment models** based on **new regulatory guidance from financial authorities**.

# Requirements Management

## **Objective**
Requirements Management in TOGAF ensures that **architecture development aligns with business needs** and remains adaptable to changes. It acts as a **continuous process** that integrates with all ADM phases to track, prioritize, and validate evolving requirements.

### **Key Goals:**
- Establish **traceability** between business objectives and architectural decisions.
- Maintain **consistency and accuracy** in requirements across all ADM phases.
- Adapt to **changing business needs** through effective requirement updates.
- Ensure **stakeholder alignment** to prevent project scope creep.

---

## **Inputs**
Requirements Management relies on multiple inputs from various ADM phases:

| **Input** | **Description** | **Example** |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Business Goals & Strategies** | High-level business objectives that the architecture must support. | *A retail company wants to unify its online and in-store experiences.* |
| **Stakeholder Needs** | Concerns and requirements gathered from key stakeholders. | *The CFO requires real-time financial reporting, while IT wants cloud compatibility.* |
| **Architecture Vision (Phase A)** | High-level aspirational view of the architectureâ€™s capabilities. | *A logistics company aims to implement AI-driven route optimization.* |
| **Gap Analysis (Phases B, C, D)** | Identified deficiencies between current and target architectures. | *An outdated ERP system lacks API integrations for modern apps.* |
| **Regulatory & Compliance Standards** | Legal and industry requirements that the architecture must adhere to. | *GDPR for data privacy, PCI-DSS for payment security.* |
| **Technology Constraints** | Limitations due to existing IT infrastructure, budgets, or skills. | *A legacy mainframe system prevents seamless cloud adoption.* |

## **Steps in Requirements Management**
The Requirements Management process follows these steps to **ensure controlled handling of evolving requirements**:

### **1. Capture Requirements**
- Conduct **workshops, surveys, and stakeholder interviews**.
- Document both **functional and non-functional requirements**.
- Example: *A hospital IT system must ensure patient data security (non-functional) and support digital appointment booking (functional).*

### **2. Validate & Prioritize Requirements**
- Check for **alignment with business strategy** and feasibility.
- Categorize requirements based on priority: **Must-Have, Should-Have, Nice-to-Have**.
- Example: *A bank must meet regulatory compliance before implementing AI-based customer insights.*

### **3. Integrate with ADM Phases**
- Requirements flow **bi-directionally** between ADM phases.
- Ensure architecture decisions remain aligned with updated business needs.
- Example: *A retail company pivots to mobile-first development after customer trends shift.*

### **4. Assess Impact of Changes**
- Evaluate if requirement changes affect other areas of architecture.
- Adjust roadmaps, budgets, and technical dependencies as needed.
- Example: *A new cybersecurity requirement necessitates reworking the cloud migration plan.*

### **5. Track & Maintain Requirements**
- Maintain a **Requirements Repository** to track status and history.
- Use tools like **JIRA, Confluence, or IBM DOORS** for traceability.
- Example: *A government agency tracks evolving legislative IT mandates.*
