# Phase F: Migration Planning

## Purpose

The **Migration Planning** phase ensures that the transition from the **current (baseline) architecture** to the **future (target) architecture** is well-structured, cost-effective, and aligned with business priorities. It establishes a **detailed implementation roadmap**, ensuring that technology and process changes are rolled out **in a controlled manner with minimal disruption**.

## Objectives

- **Prioritize Implementation Projects** – Rank projects based on **business impact, cost, dependencies, and risk**.
- **Develop a Detailed Migration Plan** – Define **timelines, resource allocation, and delivery models** for implementation.
- **Align with Business and IT Frameworks** – Ensure that migration activities **integrate with enterprise strategy, risk management, and compliance policies**.
- **Establish Governance Structures** – Set up **oversight mechanisms to track progress, resolve issues, and ensure compliance**.

---

## Approach

This phase translates architectural designs into **actionable projects**. Enterprise architects, IT leaders, and project managers collaborate to develop a **sequenced implementation plan**, ensuring **incremental value delivery** while mitigating risks.

---

## Steps

### 1. Confirm Alignment with Management Frameworks
- **What:** Ensure that migration efforts align with **business operations, risk management, and IT governance frameworks**.
- **Example:** A **global bank** integrates its **core banking system upgrade plan** with **regulatory compliance frameworks** to meet new financial regulations.

### 2. Assign Business Value to Projects
- **What:** Rank migration initiatives based on **ROI, strategic importance, and risk reduction**.
- **Example:** A **retail company** prioritizes the rollout of **AI-driven customer recommendations** to enhance sales and increase customer retention.

### 3. Estimate Resource Requirements and Timelines
- **What:** Identify **infrastructure, personnel, training, and budget needs** for each work package.
- **Example:** A **cloud services provider** allocates **dedicated DevOps teams** to manage the **phased migration of legacy applications to Kubernetes**.

### 4. Conduct Cost/Benefit and Risk Analysis
- **What:** Evaluate **dependencies, estimated costs, and expected benefits**.
- **Example:** A **healthcare provider** assesses the **risks of EHR data migration**, ensuring no patient data loss during the **transition to a cloud-based records system**.

### 5. Define Migration Work Packages and Dependencies
- **What:** Break down **migration into manageable work packages** while ensuring that dependencies are considered.
- **Example:** A **telecommunications company** plans a **stepwise upgrade of its 5G infrastructure**, starting in major cities before expanding nationwide.

### 6. Develop the Implementation and Migration Plan
- **What:** Establish a **comprehensive roadmap with milestones, governance checkpoints, and contingency plans**.
- **Example:** A **government agency** implements **a multi-year digital transformation program**, modernizing its citizen services portal in **incremental releases**.

### 7. Set Up Governance and Compliance Mechanisms
- **What:** Define how **progress will be tracked, issues will be resolved, and compliance will be enforced**.
- **Example:** A **financial institution** implements **automated monitoring dashboards** to track **real-time compliance with data security standards**.

### 8. Conduct Stakeholder Review and Secure Approvals
- **What:** Engage **business leaders, IT teams, compliance officers, and finance teams** to validate the migration plan.
- **Example:** A **logistics company** ensures that **warehouse automation deployment** aligns with **supply chain leadership expectations**.

### 9. Finalize and Launch the Migration Plan
- **What:** Document all **timelines, budgets, responsibilities, and tracking mechanisms** before execution begins.
- **Example:** A **software enterprise** finalizes the **decommissioning plan for legacy monolithic applications**, replacing them with **microservices architecture**.
