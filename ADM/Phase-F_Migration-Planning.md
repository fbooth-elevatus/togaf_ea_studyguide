# Phase F: Migration Planning

## Purpose
Phase F finalizes the detailed Implementation and Migration Plan to transition from the baseline to the target architecture. It prioritizes work packages, assesses risks and dependencies, and ensures the plan is actionable and aligned with business priorities.

- **Key Objective:** Create a concrete, prioritized roadmap for architecture implementation.

## Key Activities
- **Consolidate Gaps and Solutions:** Review outputs from Phases B-E to finalize transition architectures.
- **Prioritize Work Packages:** Rank projects based on business value, cost, and dependencies.
- **Assess Risks and Mitigation:** Identify risks (e.g., delays, costs) and define mitigation strategies.
- **Estimate Resources and Costs:** Calculate budgets, timelines, and staffing needs.
- **Develop Migration Plan:** Detail the sequence of projects and transition states.
- **Define Governance Structure:** Outline how implementation will be monitored (links to Phase G).
- **Validate with Stakeholders:** Gain approval for the plan from key stakeholders.

## Inputs
- **Architecture Vision:** From Phase A, guiding strategic alignment.
- **Architecture Definition Document:** Consolidated from Phases B-D with target architectures.
- **Implementation and Migration Strategy:** High-level options from Phase E.
- **Architecture Roadmap:** Draft roadmap and work packages from Phase E.
- **Gap Analysis Results:** Gaps and dependencies from prior phases.
- **Stakeholder Requirements:** Updated priorities and constraints.

## Outputs
- **Implementation and Migration Plan:** Detailed, prioritized plan with timelines and resources.
- **Finalized Architecture Roadmap:** Complete sequence of transition architectures.
- **Transition Architectures:** Defined intermediate states between baseline and target.
- **Project Portfolio:** List of prioritized work packages with costs and benefits.
- **Risk Mitigation Plan:** Strategies to address implementation risks.
- **Updated Architecture Definition Document:** Finalized for implementation handover.

## Key Concepts
- **Migration Plan:** A detailed schedule of how to achieve the target architecture.
- **Transition Architectures:** Stepping stones (e.g., “Phase 1: Cloud Migration”) to the final state.
- **Prioritization:** Balances business value, cost, and risk—key for decision-making.
- **Risk Management:** Critical in Phase F to ensure feasibility.

## Study Notes
- **Exam Focus:** Know Phase F as the planning phase before execution. Memorize its role in finalizing the roadmap.
- **Link to Phase E:** Builds on opportunities and solutions—understand this handoff.
- **Deliverables:** The Implementation and Migration Plan is a star output—be able to describe it.
- **Risk and Cost:** These considerations are testable—focus on their importance here.

## Example Scenario
- **Context:** Retail company modernizing its e-commerce platform (from Phases A-E).
- **Phase F Steps:**
  1. Work Packages: “Migrate to AWS,” “Deploy new CRM.”
  2. Prioritization: Cloud first (enables CRM), based on cost and customer impact.
  3. Plan: Q1: Cloud setup; Q2: CRM rollout.
  4. Risks: Downtime during migration—mitigate with testing.
  5. Output: Migration Plan approved by IT and execs.
