## Steps

### 1. Identify Key Business Drivers Influencing Implementation
- **What:** Determine the **business priorities, regulatory constraints, and competitive pressures** shaping the implementation approach.
- **Example:** A **banking institution** prioritizes **fraud detection automation** due to increasing cybersecurity threats and compliance requirements.

### 2. Review Gap Analysis from Previous Phases
- **What:** Assess **gaps between the current and target architecture** to identify essential transformation areas.
- **Example:** A **healthcare provider** finds that **legacy patient data systems** lack integration with modern **AI-based diagnostic tools**.

### 3. Define Technical and Functional Requirements
- **What:** Develop **solution requirements** based on business needs and technical capabilities.
- **Example:** A **retail company** specifies the need for a **real-time inventory tracking system** integrated with its **e-commerce and warehouse platforms**.

### 4. Identify Integration and Co-Existence Requirements
- **What:** Ensure that **new solutions can integrate with existing systems** without disrupting operations.
- **Example:** A **manufacturing company** ensures that **IoT sensors for predictive maintenance** are compatible with its **existing ERP system**.

### 5. Assess Possible Solution Options
- **What:** Evaluate **alternative solutions** for cost, complexity, and alignment with business goals.
- **Example:** A **telecom provider** compares **cloud-native 5G infrastructure vs. hybrid on-prem/cloud deployment** for network upgrades.

### 6. Define Work Packages and Major Projects
- **What:** Break down the **implementation roadmap into structured work packages** for execution.
- **Example:** A **government agency** structures **data privacy upgrades** as separate projects, including **encryption enhancements, user access controls, and compliance audits**.

### 7. Assess Dependencies, Costs, and Business Benefits
- **What:** Analyze **project interdependencies, estimated costs, and expected ROI**.
- **Example:** An **automotive company** evaluates the **cost-benefit of transitioning from on-prem data centers to cloud AI-based manufacturing analytics**.

### 8. Develop the Implementation Roadmap
- **What:** Create a **step-by-step timeline** aligning **business objectives with technology deployments**.
- **Example:** A **fintech startup** develops a **multi-year roadmap for blockchain-based smart contracts, starting with a pilot phase before full-scale adoption**.

### 9. Conduct Stakeholder Review
- **What:** Engage **executives, IT leaders, and business units** to review feasibility and refine priorities.
- **Example:** A **pharmaceutical company** reviews its **cloud-based clinical trial management platform** with **regulatory and research teams**.

### 10. Finalize and Approve the Solution Architecture
- **What:** Document **approved solutions, budget requirements, and governance policies** before execution.
- **Example:** A **logistics company** finalizes a **plan for AI-driven demand forecasting and automated warehouse operations**.
