# Phase G: Implementation Governance

## Purpose
Phase G provides architecture oversight and governance during the implementation of the solutions identified in Phase F. It ensures that projects conform to the target architecture, monitors progress, and addresses any deviations to maintain alignment with the Architecture Vision.

- **Key Objective:** Ensure the implemented solutions match the defined architecture and deliver business value.

## Key Activities
- **Establish Governance Framework:** Define roles, responsibilities, and compliance processes.
- **Review Implementation Plans:** Confirm alignment with the Architecture Definition Document.
- **Conduct Architecture Compliance Reviews:** Assess projects against architecture standards and principles.
- **Monitor Implementation:** Track progress of work packages and transition architectures.
- **Resolve Issues:** Address deviations or non-compliance with corrective actions.
- **Update Architecture:** Incorporate lessons learned or necessary adjustments.
- **Support Stakeholders:** Provide guidance to project teams and report to sponsors.

## Inputs
- **Architecture Vision:** From Phase A, setting the strategic context.
- **Architecture Definition Document:** Finalized architectures from Phases B-D.
- **Implementation and Migration Plan:** Detailed plan from Phase F.
- **Architecture Roadmap:** Transition sequence from Phase F.
- **Architecture Repository:** Standards, principles, and building blocks.
- **Contracts and Specifications:** Agreements with implementation teams.

## Outputs
- **Architecture-Compliant Solutions:** Implemented systems matching the target architecture.
- **Compliance Review Reports:** Documentation of adherence or deviations.
- **Updated Architecture Definition Document:** Adjusted based on implementation feedback.
- **Governance Artifacts:** Records of oversight (e.g., checklists, approvals).
- **Implementation Status Reports:** Progress updates for stakeholders.
- **Change Requests:** Proposals for architecture updates, if needed.

## Key Concepts
- **Architecture Governance:** Ensures consistency and alignment with architecture goals.
- **Compliance Review:** A formal check to verify implementation matches the architecture.
- **Transition Architectures:** Monitored here as they are deployed.
- **Deviation Management:** Handling when projects stray from the plan.

## Study Notes
- **Exam Focus:** Know Phase G as the governance phase during implementation. Understand its role in ensuring compliance.
- **Link to Phase F:** Builds on the Migration Plan—grasp how governance enforces planning.
- **Deliverables:** Memorize Compliance Review Reports and their purpose.
- **Governance:** A big TOGAF theme—be ready for questions on its application here.

## Example Scenario
- **Context:** Retail company modernizing its e-commerce platform (from Phases A-F).
- **Phase G Steps:**
  1. Governance: Set up an Architecture Board to oversee cloud migration.
  2. Review: Check AWS setup against Technology Architecture (Phase D).
  3. Compliance: Confirm CRM deployment matches Application Architecture.
  4. Issue: Network latency detected—adjust with additional bandwidth.
  5. Output: Compliance report and updated roadmap approved by IT leads.
