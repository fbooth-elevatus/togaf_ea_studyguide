# Phase B: Business Architecture

## Purpose
Phase B develops the Business Architecture, describing how the enterprise operates to achieve its business goals. It provides a baseline and target view of the organization’s structure, processes, and capabilities, serving as the foundation for subsequent architecture domains (Data, Application, Technology).

- **Key Objective:** Define the business context and capabilities needed to support the Architecture Vision.

## Key Activities
- **Select Reference Models and Viewpoints:** Choose standards or frameworks relevant to the business domain.
- **Develop Baseline Business Architecture:** Document the current state (as-is) of business processes, organization, and capabilities.
- **Develop Target Business Architecture:** Define the desired future state (to-be) aligned with the Architecture Vision.
- **Perform Gap Analysis:** Identify differences between baseline and target architectures.
- **Define Business Requirements:** Capture functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Validate with Stakeholders:** Review and refine the architecture with stakeholder feedback.
- **Update Architecture Vision:** Adjust based on findings, if needed.

## Inputs
- **Architecture Vision:** From Phase A, including scope and principles.
- **Statement of Architecture Work:** Approved project scope and constraints.
- **Business Strategy:** Goals, objectives, and drivers from the enterprise.
- **Existing Business Models:** Current process documentation, org charts, etc.
- **Architecture Repository:** Reusable building blocks or reference models.

## Outputs
- **Business Architecture Document:** Detailed baseline and target descriptions (processes, functions, roles).
- **Refined Architecture Vision:** Updated based on business insights.
- **Gap Analysis Results:** List of gaps between baseline and target.
- **Business Requirements:** Documented needs for the architecture.
- **Updated Stakeholder Map:** Revised based on Phase B engagement.
- **Draft Architecture Definition Document:** Expanded with Business Architecture details.

## Key Concepts
- **Business Capability:** What the organization does (e.g., “Order Processing”).
- **Process Modeling:** Techniques like BPMN may be used to map workflows.
- **Gap Analysis:** Essential for identifying what needs to change to reach the target state.
- **Viewpoints:** Perspectives (e.g., process view, organizational view) tailored to stakeholders.

## Study Notes
- **Exam Focus:** Know Phase B’s role as the first detailed architecture phase. Memorize key outputs like the Business Architecture Document and Gap Analysis.
- **Link to Phase A:** Phase B builds on the Architecture Vision—understand how the vision drives business requirements.
- **Techniques:** Gap Analysis and stakeholder validation are testable—review their purpose and steps.
- **Domain Focus:** Business Architecture is one of the four TOGAF domains (with Data, Application, Technology).

## Example Scenario
- **Context:** A retail company modernizing its e-commerce platform (from Phase A).
- **Phase B Steps:**
  1. Baseline: Document current manual order processing and siloed departments.
  2. Target: Define streamlined, automated order fulfillment and integrated teams.
  3. Gap: Identify lack of CRM system and process automation.
  4. Output: Business Architecture showing new processes, validated by the operations team.
