# Phase B: Business Architecture

## Purpose

The **Business Architecture** phase defines how an enterprise operates to achieve its strategic objectives. It establishes a structured understanding of **business processes, organizational structures, information flows, and capabilities**. This phase ensures that business goals align with **technology, IT systems, and enterprise applications**. It provides the foundation for the **Data, Application, and Technology Architectures** in later phases.

## Objectives

- **Define the Target Business Architecture** – Describe the **desired future state** of business processes, roles, and capabilities.
- **Analyze the Current Business Architecture** – Document **existing workflows, enterprise applications, and IT service models**.
- **Perform a Gap Analysis** – Identify **differences between the current and future state** of business operations and IT.
- **Develop a Business Architecture Roadmap** – Define **projects and initiatives** that will drive business and IT transformation.
- **Ensure Business and IT Alignment** – Validate that the **architecture integrates effectively with IT applications, infrastructure, and cloud strategies**.

## Approach

This phase begins by assessing the **Baseline Business Architecture** (current IT and business state) and then defining the **Target Business Architecture** (future state). The process leverages **industry reference models, IT service management frameworks (ITIL, COBIT), and business capability models**. A **Gap Analysis** determines what IT and business process changes are needed to bridge the difference between the two states.

## Steps

1. **Select Reference Models and Tools**
   - Choose **industry best practices, IT frameworks, and modeling tools**.
   - **Example:** A **SaaS company** selects **APQC process classification** and **ArchiMate** for enterprise architecture modeling.

2. **Develop Baseline Business Architecture**
   - Document **existing IT applications, infrastructure, and workflows**.
   - **Example:** A **cloud computing company** maps its **current DevOps pipeline, CI/CD workflow, and customer onboarding process**.

3. **Develop Target Business Architecture**
   - Define the **future IT and business state** aligned with the company's goals.
   - **Example:** A **fintech startup** aims to transition from **on-premise legacy banking systems to cloud-native microservices**.

4. **Perform Gap Analysis**
   - Identify **differences in applications, IT governance, and processes**.
   - **Example:** A **software company** identifies the **need for API management solutions** to enhance integration with partners.

5. **Define Candidate Roadmap Components**
   - Outline **IT modernization projects and technology upgrades**.
   - **Example:** A **cybersecurity company** plans to implement **zero-trust architecture** to enhance data security.

6. **Ensure Architecture Alignment**
   - Verify that the **business and IT strategy are aligned**.
   - **Example:** A **large e-commerce platform** ensures that **its cloud migration aligns with a customer-centric digital transformation strategy**.

7. **Conduct Stakeholder Review**
   - Present findings to **business and IT stakeholders** for validation.
   - **Example:** A **healthtech company** gathers feedback from **compliance teams, DevOps engineers, and product managers** before adopting **FHIR-based interoperability standards**.

8. **Finalize the Business Architecture**
   - Document **all findings, secure approvals, and transition to Phase C**.
   - **Example:** A **global IT consulting firm** completes the **business architecture documentation for its multi-cloud SaaS migration plan**.
