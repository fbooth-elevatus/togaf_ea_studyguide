# Phase A: Architecture Vision

## Purpose

The **Architecture Vision** phase establishes a high-level view of the **target architecture** and ensures alignment with business goals. It sets the foundation for enterprise architecture efforts, securing stakeholder agreement on the **scope, objectives, and expected outcomes** of the architecture project.

## Objectives

- **Define the Scope of the Architecture** – Identify the **business, data, application, and technology domains** involved.
- **Ensure Alignment with Business Goals** – Validate that the architecture supports the **strategic direction** of the organization.
- **Secure Stakeholder Buy-in** – Engage decision-makers and demonstrate the value of enterprise architecture.
- **Develop an Initial Architecture Vision** – Outline the **Baseline and Target Architectures** in a high-level conceptual model.
- **Obtain Approval to Proceed** – Formalize agreement through a **Statement of Architecture Work**.

## Approach

This phase **establishes the architecture project** by defining its purpose, scope, and constraints. The **Architecture Vision** serves as a communication tool for engaging stakeholders and aligning expectations before proceeding with detailed architecture development.

## Steps

1. **Establish the Architecture Project**
   - Define **objectives, constraints, and assumptions** for the architecture effort.
   - Identify **key stakeholders** and secure executive sponsorship.

2. **Identify Stakeholders and Their Concerns**
   - Map out **business leaders, IT teams, compliance officers, and end-users**.
   - Capture their concerns, expectations, and success criteria.

3. **Develop Business Scenarios**
   - Use real-world **use cases and business drivers** to demonstrate the need for architecture change.
   - Identify **pain points and opportunities** within the current state.

4. **Create the Architecture Vision**
   - Develop a high-level view of the **target architecture**.
   - Define how the architecture will **support business transformation**.

5. **Define Scope and Constraints**
   - Establish **what is in and out of scope** for the architecture development.
   - Identify **dependencies and integration points** with existing systems.

6. **Assess Risks**
   - Identify **potential challenges** in implementation.
   - Define mitigation strategies to ensure a smooth transition.

7. **Develop the Statement of Architecture Work**
   - Document the **plan, deliverables, and success criteria**.
   - Define the approach for progressing to **Phase B**.

8. **Gain Approval**
   - Present the **Architecture Vision** and Statement of Architecture Work to stakeholders.
   - Obtain formal sign-off before proceeding.
