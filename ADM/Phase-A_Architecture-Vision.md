# Phase A: Architecture Vision

## Purpose
Phase A establishes the high-level vision for the architecture project, aligning it with business goals and stakeholder needs. It defines the scope, identifies key stakeholders, and secures approval to proceed with the architecture development.

- **Key Objective:** Create a compelling vision to gain stakeholder buy-in and set the stage for subsequent ADM phases.

## Key Activities
- **Establish the Architecture Project:** Define the project’s scope, objectives, and constraints.
- **Identify Stakeholders:** Map stakeholders, their concerns, and requirements.
- **Develop Business Scenarios:** Use scenarios to articulate business needs and drivers.
- **Create the Architecture Vision:** Draft a high-level view of the target architecture (business, data, application, technology).
- **Assess Risks:** Identify initial risks and mitigation strategies.
- **Gain Approval:** Present the vision to stakeholders for sign-off via a Statement of Architecture Work.

## Inputs
- **Request for Architecture Work:** Trigger from the sponsoring organization.
- **Business Strategy:** Organizational goals and drivers.
- **Architecture Framework:** Tailored framework from the Preliminary Phase.
- **Existing Models:** Any baseline architecture or reference materials.
- **Principles:** Architecture principles defined in the Preliminary Phase.

## Outputs
- **Architecture Vision Document:** High-level description of the target architecture.
- **Stakeholder Map:** List of stakeholders, roles, and concerns.
- **Statement of Architecture Work:** Contract-like document defining scope, schedule, and responsibilities.
- **Validated Principles:** Refined principles aligned with the vision.
- **Draft Architecture Definition Document:** Initial outline for subsequent phases.
- **Communication Plan:** Strategy for engaging stakeholders.

## Key Concepts
- **Stakeholder Management:** Critical in Phase A to ensure alignment and support.
- **Business Scenarios:** Technique to capture business needs and test the vision.
- **Scope Definition:** Sets boundaries—what’s in and out of the architecture effort.

## Study Notes
- **Exam Focus:** Understand the purpose of Phase A as the starting point of the ADM cycle. Know the difference between inputs (e.g., Request for Architecture Work) and outputs (e.g., Statement of Architecture Work).
- **Key Deliverable:** The Architecture Vision is the “why” and “what” of the project—memorize its components.
- **Link to Other Phases:** Phase A feeds into Phase B (Business Architecture) and relies on the Preliminary Phase’s groundwork.
- **Techniques:** Be familiar with stakeholder mapping and business scenarios—they’re testable!

## Example Scenario
- **Context:** A retail company wants to modernize its e-commerce platform.
- **Phase A Steps:** 
  1. Identify stakeholders (e.g., CIO, marketing team, IT ops).
  2. Define vision: “A scalable, customer-centric online platform.”
  3. Scope: Include application and technology layers, exclude physical store redesign.
  4. Output: Architecture Vision document approved by the CIO.
